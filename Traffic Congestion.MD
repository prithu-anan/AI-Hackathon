AI-powered **Smart Traffic Management System**:

| **Steps**                | **Existing Solution** | **New Problem** | **New Ideation** |
|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Preprocessing**        | Traffic data is collected manually or through basic sensors but lacks real-time adaptation. | Data inconsistency from multiple sources (CCTV, IoT sensors, GPS) leads to unreliable congestion tracking. | AI-powered **data fusion** integrates **real-time feeds from GPS, traffic cameras, and sensors**, ensuring accurate and dynamic traffic monitoring. |
| **Feature Extraction**   | Traffic signals operate on **fixed timers** without considering real-time congestion. | No dynamic adjustment to **emergency vehicles, peak hours, or road blockages**. | AI-powered **computer vision detects congestion levels**, **identifies bottlenecks**, and **predicts future traffic density**. |
| **Feature Classification** | Vehicles and congestion data are classified using **simple threshold-based methods**. | Traditional systems lack **detailed classification** for traffic flow, public transport load balancing, and emergency prioritization. | Machine learning models classify traffic conditions into **low, medium, high congestion zones** and **adjust traffic signals dynamically**. |
